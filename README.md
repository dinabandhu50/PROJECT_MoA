## Data config
- Create folders input/raw and input/processed in the root directory
- Download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/data and store the unziped files in the input/raw 

## Project Overview
- The project is for learning how to use optuna with pytorch. The code is taken from youtube video of "Abhishek Thakur" (youtube channel).
- Things I have learn from this project:
    - multilabel problem
    - creating ml/dl folder structure
    - pytorch 
    - optuna

## Recreate the project
- You should have anaconda installed
- You should not have conda environment with name 'moa'
- Run setup.sh
    - this will setup the conda environment as well as download the data files.
